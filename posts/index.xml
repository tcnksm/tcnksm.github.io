      <description>I’ve been working as a platform engineer (platformer) for almost 5 years. In the previous company, I worked on the internal PaaS based onCloud Foundry and, in the current company, I’ve been working on themicroservices platform based onKubernetes.
If you’ve done one thing for 5 years, you will have things that you take for granted as a matter of habit and become the basis of daily decision making, which is neutral from specific technologies.</description>
